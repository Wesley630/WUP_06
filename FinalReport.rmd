# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?.  If you skimp in this section expect to be marked down in your grade. Paint a picture of the project a couple of paragraphs is expected!-->

Is attitude toward capitol punishment (cappun) independent of race (race)?
If not, then whose view differs from whom??

# Methods

<!--Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method. Discuss what data manipulations may be needed for example subsetting or other binning procedures and what sort of graphical displays and inferential tools will be used!-->

# Results

<!--Divide this section into two sub-sections:  One for your descriptive  results and one for your inferential results.!-->

## Descriptive Results

### Graphical Descriptive Results

<!--Graphical results here.  Make sure to show your code.  Provide appropriate labels for axes, giving units if possible, and provide a good title for the graph, too.  Use the graphical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question. Bottom line is to explain the features of the graph that are relevant to conforming or departing to what is expected by your null hypothesis !-->

```{r}
barchartGC(~race + cappun,data=mydata)
barchartGC(~race + cappun,data=mydata, type="percent")

```
  
  
  The graph shows that white people favor favor capital punishment the most next is the other and the least to favor is black.




## Now with The Most data (fewer variables gives more data points)



### Numerical Descriptive Results

<!--Numerical results go here. Use the numerical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->


```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~race + cappun, data=mydata)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```

With the white people there are 65% who are in favor while 34% oppose capitol punishment. The group other 55% favor while 44% oppose and with the population of black people there are 43% who favor and 57% who oppose. 



## Now with More data


## Inferential Results

<!--State hypothesis clearly.  Make sure your discussion of the inferential test covers all the aspects that the test output produces, such as test statistic, p-value etc.  Make a decision about the null hypothesis, explain the assumptions on which the selected test/procedure was based, and why the chosen procedure satisfys the assumptions and is appropriate to answer the research question!-->

```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
chisqtestGC(table1)
fisher.test(table1)
```


```{r}
fisherXY(mydata$race,mydata$cappun,printAll=TRUE)
```




With the data up top we can see that there were 1300 people who were in favor of capitol punishment while the other 697 people were against it.With the other there was 138 in favor and 112 who opposed.
with the black population there was 191 who were in favor and 257 who opposed. From the fisherXY test, we can that statistically, each race differs from another making all t-test results significant. 


## More data version


# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If you found a relationship be sure to consider whether the relationship occurs because one of the variavbles causes the other, or whether they perhasps are related for some other reason.  Watch the chapter 6 videos from the GeorgeTown videos collection.!-->



With the data given to us for each branch we were given 2,867 data points versus the second branch we were given around 800 data points. This only gave us one set of data that can be seen as significant since the second data set given did not have enough information to allow for there to be significance in the fisherXY showing the differences. we were able to see that overall for both data sets, the white population had the highest amount of those favoring the capital punishment with other population as the second highest and the black population as the lowest.
